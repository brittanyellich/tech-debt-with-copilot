# Tackling Your Tech Debt with GitHub Copilot Coding Agent

Hi there! Thank you for stopping by to get the notes. Below is a list of things that I highly recommend looking into if you'd like to learn more about using GitHub Copilot coding agent to take care of the tech debt in your backlog üí™

## üéÅ WRAP up your backlog!

### 1. Write effective instructions
  - Add enough context that a new person joining the team could pick up the issue
  - Pinpoint where you want the changes to be made
  - Use a descriptive title
  - Include examples if you have them!
  - 
### 2. Repository instructions
  - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions): repository custom instructions files that give Copilot additional context on how to understand your project and how to build, test and validate its changes.

### 3. Atomic tasks
  - Break down big problems into multiple smaller problems

### 4. Pair with the coding agent
  - Remember what humans are good at:
    - **Understanding the "why"** - Knowing whether a change will actually solve the correct problem
    - **Navigating ambiguity** - Figuring out what to build when requirements are vague or conflicting
    - **Reading between the lines** - Understanding unstated user needs or business constraints
    - **Cross-system thinking** - Seeing how changes ripple across the codebase and organization
  - Remember what the coding agent is good at:
    - **Expanding upon existing patterns** - Replicating code style and conventions across the codebase
    - **Tireless execution** - Refactoring 50 files without fatigue or boredom
    - **Repetitive tasks** - Writing boilerplate, tests, or documentation at scale
    - **Exploring possibilities** - Trying multiple implementation approaches quickly
  - Pair with the coding agent to leverage the parts that it's good at that you don't have the time to do

- [Prompt engineering for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/prompt-engineering) - A prompt is a request that you make to GitHub Copilot. For example, a question that you ask Copilot Chat, or a code snippet that you ask Copilot to complete. In addition to your prompt, Copilot uses additional context, like the code in your current file and the chat history, to generate a response. Follow the tips in this article to write prompts that generate better responses from Copilot.
- [5 tips for writing better custom instructions for Copilot](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/5-tips-for-writing-better-custom-instructions-for-copilot/) - GitHub Copilot can provide chat responses that are tailored to the way your team works, the tools you use, or the specifics of your project. Instead of repeatedly adding this contextual detail to your chat prompts, you can create files in your repository that automatically add this information for you. If you're using GitHub Copilot in your enterprise projects, writing effective custom instructions is no longer optional‚Äîit‚Äôs essential. This guide shows how a well-crafted copilot-instructions.md file can dramatically improve Copilot‚Äôs code suggestions by giving it the context your team already knows but the AI doesn‚Äôt.
